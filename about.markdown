Hello! I'm __Henrique Pettenuci__, a dedicated professional passionate about Cloud Computing, DevOps Culture, SRE, and modern infrastructure management. My journey began with a solid foundation in programming, systems administration, and relational databases management.

Over time, my career expanded into the realm of cloud native solutions. I've successfully migrated legacy systems to the cloud, implemented Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) practices using Terraform, and built fully containerized environments orchestrated with Kubernetes. With extensive experience deploying applications on AWS—and hands-on projects in Azure and GCP—I have mastered the art of designing automated CI/CD pipelines, ensuring seamless integration between development and operations.

Advancing in my career, I moved from executing technical projects to taking on leadership roles. As a Tech Lead, I made key technical decisions, guided my team of DevOps Engineers, and planned critical roadmap improvements. Today, as DevOps & SRE Manager, I steer strategic planning, align cross-functional teams, manage talent, and oversee high-level project reviews, consistently driving solutions that support business objectives.
